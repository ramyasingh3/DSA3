Problem: Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS)
and the subsequence itself. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence
by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3, "ace"
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3, "abc"
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0, ""
Explanation: There is no common subsequence, so return 0.
